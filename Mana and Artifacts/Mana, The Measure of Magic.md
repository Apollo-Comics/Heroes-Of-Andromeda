# Mana, The Measure of Magic

Mana is the measure of how much magic someone has. Like stamina, it can be drained but in most cases when mana is drained the user isn't tired. In cases like Maxwell who has super-speed, he physically uses his legs to run which take both stamina and mana.

# How to use mana?
Every being posseses mana, but most don't know how to use it/don't know they do. To begin using it you need an artifact, most come in forms of jewelry such as necklaces, earrings, noserings, bracelets, rings etc. Things such as staffs and wands are also used. In rare cases, users don't need an artifact.

Magic/Mana users who started with artifacts eventually lose the need for them when experienced enough. By that time though, most users grow attached to their artifacts and keep using them even without needing them (this does not make them dependant on their artifact). Beings such as Gods, Demigods and Titans do not need artifacts to use mana.

Beings such as Gods, Demigods and Titans (the most powerful ones) have infinite mana. Example of this are Madonna and the God of Horror (GoH). Infinite mana can be achieved by being very very experienced (like Titans) or by being born as a god/demigod.

## Characters in the story who use mana:

-

Carlos has a necklace, it is an upside down crescent moon with a aquamarine eye between the tips of the moon. When using magic that requires a lot of stamina, the eye turns red.

-

Maxwell has nothing, the lightning striked a mana pressure point which charged the mana. This gave him his super-speed.

-

Benjamin (Mr.Bombastic) also has nothing. He is a Titan so he can use mana without having to use an artifact.

-

Louise (The Mime) has an earring which gives her the powers of Cartoon Physics.
