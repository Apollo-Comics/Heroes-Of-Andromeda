# Artifacts, Channeling Mana

As stated in [Mana, The Measure of Magic](https://github.com/Sabbydabs/Sabbaverse/blob/d988613e5cbf720499db93adffda542caefddfae/Mana%20and%20Artifacts/Mana,%20The%20Measure%20of%20Magic.md), artifacts help people to begin using magic. 

# Types and Classes

## Types
Ancient - These are the original artifacts made by the \[clan name here]. These are usually more powerful than synthetic ones. All of them are special class.

Synthetic - These are man-made artifacts. They can be made by anyone but they are mostly made by universities, companies or the government. They are usually on the normal class, making them into a special class takes a lot of time and is very difficult to do.

## Classes
Normal - This class of artifacts only channel magic and don't have a special power. You can not use both at the same time no matter how much mana you have. 

Special - This class of artifacts channel magic and has a power unique to the artifact. This unique power can be used by a beginner and does not need prior experience with magic.
- If the user has enough mana, they can use 2 or more Special Artifacts at the same time.
- Some of the unique powers of artifacts are very hard to emulate with normal magic.
