I have this super hero/villain/creature universe in my head. I think they're good characters and I honestly don't want to lose them so I'll put them here.

Some important info: 

In this I'll be categorizing species by classes, there are 8 classes:

**God** - Near all powerful celestial beings.

**Subgod** - Protectors/Less powerful than Gods.

**Alien** - Creatures from planets that are not Earth.

**Superalien** - Aliens with powers/abilities that are better than the normal powers/abilities of their alien race.

**Human** - The people/dominating species of Earth.

**Superhuman** - Humans with powers/ablities that are better than the normal powers/abilities of humans.

**Creature** - Creatures from Earth that are not humans. 

**Supercreture** - Creatures with powers/ablities that are better than the normal powers/abilities of their creature race.
