# Vampires

### - General Info -

**Species Name:** Vampires. 

**History:** The first vampire, Cain, was cursed with immortality to forever wander the Earth as punishment for killing his brother, Abel. Cain roamed the Earth for many years, his immortality tortured him as he saw his friends and family die, he suffered from the eternal guilt of killing his brother. 

Unfortunately, he had other punishments besides immortality such as not being able to eat normally. Cain had to drink blood and eat raw flesh in order to remain healthy. He tried to starve himself but the emptiness he felt in his stomach would become to painful to handle. Every time he ate he got sick and blacked out, but eventually he would grow an immunity to the diseases. Another punishment was that if he ever looked at the full moon he would get sick. He'd feel his skin become itchy, his ears would ring, he'd sweat profusely, he'd get terrible migranes, and his skin would turn a dark grey. He would hide in caves and in total darkness every time there was a full moon. All of his torture drove him insane, he tried many ways to kill himself but none worked, he'd always wake up intact in a coffin, as if nothing had happened to him.
