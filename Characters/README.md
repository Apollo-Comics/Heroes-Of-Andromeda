# Character Cards Info

### Species Classes:

In this I'll be categorizing species by classes, there are 8 classes:

\---

**God** - Near all powerful celestial beings.

**Subgod** - Protectors/Less powerful than Gods.

\---

**Alien** - Creatures from planets that are not Earth.

**Superalien** - Aliens with powers/abilities that are better than the normal powers/abilities of their alien race.

**Human** - The people/dominating species of Earth.

**Superhuman** - Humans with powers/ablities that are better than the normal powers/abilities of humans.

\---

**Creature** - Creatures from Earth that are not humans. 

**Supercreature** - Creatures with powers/ablities that are better than the normal powers/abilities of their creature race.

### Passive and Normal Powers:

- Passive: Powers that **do not** depend on mana to work, an example would be the vampire powers of Carlos (his fangs, regeneration, etc.)

- Normal: Powers that **do** depend on mana to work, an example would be Maxwell's superspeed.

-----
### Miscellaneous Info:

- When a description has "N/A" it's because there is no description needed.

- The info here is general, the more developed bio's will be in the story.

- **Why put what perfume they smell like?** Well, why not? I like perfumes and these characters do to!
