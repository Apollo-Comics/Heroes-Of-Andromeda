**The King Inferno:** He can control the temperature of anything with just a thought, there are no limits to the power.

**Detectice Transparent Homes:** Invisible man in a detective suit. His powers are a bit of Cartoon Physics (He can use invisible stuff, like if he does a finger gun it can actually shoot bullets, or if he pretends he's on a car seat he can actually drive the invisi car). He also has another form of invisibility where the clothes he has on also turn invisible (like his gloves, cloak, shirt etc.)
